A CT scan confirmed significant liver enlargement and hepatic vein thrombosis. Follow-up appointments are scheduled with a hepatologist and cardiologist to monitor treatment response and address ongoing concerns.\n\nThe clinical course progression has been marked by worsening abdominal pain and fatigue, prompting further investigation and management. The diagnostic journey involved multiple tests, including ultrasound and CT scans, which ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. Treatment response has been moderate, with some improvement in symptoms but ongoing concerns regarding liver function and thrombosis.\n\nOngoing concerns include the risk of recurrent thrombosis and the need for long-term anticoagulation therapy. The patient will require regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment response and address any emerging issues.",

The diagnosis was confirmed through ultrasound and endoscopy findings. Treatment with spironolactone, omeprazole, AD drops, and vitamin K is ongoing to manage ascites and liver stress. However, the patient's symptoms have worsened over time, with increasing abdominal distension and loose stools. Further monitoring of liver function and serum IgG levels is necessary to guide treatment.\n\nThe patient's autoimmune profile remains negative, but low protein levels are present. The endoscopy revealed grade 2 esophageal varices without red signs. A strict salt-free diet is recommended to manage ascites and prevent further complications. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.",

His family history revealed no significant findings. Developmental milestones were met.\n\nImaging studies showed bilateral cystic kidneys with hepatic fibrosis, consistent with Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease. Lab results from May 23 revealed low hemoglobin and leukocyte esterase in urinalysis.\n\nThe patient's clinical course progression has been marked by ongoing GI bleeding. Diagnostic journey involved imaging studies and lab tests to confirm polycystic kidney disease and hepatic fibrosis. Treatment response is unknown, as no interventions were mentioned.\n\nOngoing concerns include the management of GI bleeding and monitoring liver function due to hepatic fibrosis. Further follow-up is necessary to assess treatment response and address any emerging symptoms.",
