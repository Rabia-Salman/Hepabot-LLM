What brings you here today?\n\nMother: This is my son, Muhammad Umer. He's 2.5 years old, weighs 12 kg, and is 87 cm tall. We\n\ncame in for a follow-up on his kidney disease.\n\nDoctor: Alright. Any significant family or birth history?\n\nMother:  Yes,  we  are  a  consanguineous  couple.  Umer  has  two  siblings  who  passed  away  from\n\npolycystic  kidney  disease.  Two  other  siblings  are  healthy.  He  was  born  full-term  and  had  no\n\ncomplications during birth.\n\nDoctor: Got it. Has he been meeting his developmental milestones?\n\nMother: Yes, developmentally he's normal. His vaccinations are up to date as per schedule.\n\nDoctor: When was he diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease?\n\nMother:  He  was  fine  until  6  months  of  age.  We  got  some  tests  done  during  a  minor  illness  and\n\ndiscovered he had PKD. His belly was also swollen around that time.\n\nDoctor: Any history of GI bleeding?\n\n\fMother: Yes, he had around 45 episodes of hematemesis and melena. Hes undergone band ligation\n\nthrough endoscopy seven times. The last episode of GI bleeding was in March 2022, and the most\n\nrecent endoscopy was on May 21, 2022.\n\nDoctor:  Let  me  check  the  records.
